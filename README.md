## Purpose
The purpose is to bring a gaming system that is both realistic and fun to play... when it rains its harder to run... but who wants to remember all that when playing... so the DM should be able to hit a button that says, "its raining" and all characters are updated (thus the "Things to Understand" below.

## Things To Understand
This game system, while playable with pen and paper, is designed to work with a server/client background, both to keep things in sync and to help automate the rules system, giving more time to RP.

There will be servers that are hosted professionally, as well as personal servers that can be run by DMs or other players.
