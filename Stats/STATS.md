## Constitution
Consists of attributes that define the body, these will be used to define other physicial stats.
Some physical stats can be used to agument, or reduce some Mentally Derived stats.

## Mental
Consists of attributes that indicate where ones intelligence lays.
Mental attributes can be used to adjust some Physical Derived stats, such as HP

## Points
Each category (Mental and Constitution) gets a number of points that is devided from a base total.
Lets say that base total is 15. A player could put 7 in Constitution and 8 in mental.
There is a bonus for the highest point level, as a result of a concentration on body or mind.
The higher of the two categories will get a bonus multiplier (say for now, .25 bonus, in this example, Mental would get a bonus of .25, or 2, for a total of 10).
It is possible that the lower of the 2 scores could get a reduction of .25 as well. Play testing will be required to see if this is good/bad.

### Somethings missing
  * Wisdom - many gaming systems use wisdom to help difine things such as Religious stats and other grey areas. This system uses various versions of intelligence and personality traits.
