# The Basics

First off, you need to be aware that this could be seen as a rules heavy interpretation if reality... and it is, and it isn't.

The end result should be a game that can be played by the seat of you pants, *most* of the time actions should sound like this.

__Player A__: "I toss a fireball at the goblin"  
__DM__: "Its pretty dark, environment 5 (referring to distraction and difficulty in general)"  
__Player A__: does a quick calculation (adds 5 to some pre figured number) and rolls some dice - "total 12"  
__DM__: Determines if the fireball has any effect on goblin.  
__Player B__: "I Swing my sword at the goblin"  
__DM__: "It was dark... but the goblin is now on fire, so difficulty is now 2"  
__Player B__: does a quick calculation (adds 2 to some pre figured number) and rolls some dice - "total 24"  
__DM__: "Goblin dies in a smokey mess"  

My vision would look like this as the DM

  1. the DM does most of the work
    1. He decides the general difficulty of the situations
    1. He plays the NPCs
    1. He Knows things that the players don't - players never know
  2. the PLAYER knows very little...
    1. The monster looks "easy", "tough", "looks terrifying", etc

Here is how that previous actions might work out in the DM's and Player head:

__Player A__: Its dark, so lets light the goblin on fire!!  
__DM__: Its dark, so its harder to hit the goblin, add some modifier, the goblin is small and actively avoiding everything - add some modifier  
__Player A__: DM says 5 diff, but also I have the fear of darkness add 10 to diff due to fear, rolls a 27 - 15 = 12  
__DM__: hits goblin slightly but lights him on fire  
__Player B__: wants to kill goblin with sword  
__DM__: its no longer dark, so pretty easy, but goblin is on fire... diff 2  
__Player B__: rolls 26 - 2, pretty easy kill.  
  
## Synapsis
What each player does effects the environment, this could be a fighter tripping, the wizard lighting things on fire, or even a mouse
scaring the thief...
